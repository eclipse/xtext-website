Xtext 2.35.0 ...

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Relevant changes

### Normalization of EOLs in Xbase multi-line strings

In Xbase languages (including Xtend), multi-line strings (that is, strings that span several lines, NOT Xtend template expressions) are now normalized concerning end-of-line characters, following the same strategies of [Normalization Of Line Terminators in Java Text Blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/text-blocks/index.html#normalization-of-line-terminators): Windows CR in the DSL textual sources will not be part of the string in the generated Java code, which will only contain Unix LF.
This change leads to the same Java code generated in Windows and Unix-like systems (see issue https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/2293).

This DSL string

```xtend
var s = "a multi
line string"
```

Will always result in the following generated Java code in Windows, Linux, and macOS:

```java
String s = "a multi\nline string";
```

While before, in Windows, it would have been:

```java
String s = "a multi\r\nline string";
```


Note that this change will leave intact escaped sequences (`\\r`).

## Testing

The `AbstractFormatterTest` base class has been added to the `org.eclipse.xtext.testing` package to provide a convenient way to test the formatter capabilities. The Xtext Domainmodel example project and the Xtend code base have been extended by concrete formatter test cases to demonstrate the usage of this framework class.
