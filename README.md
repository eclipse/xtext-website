This repository contains the websites [xtext.org](http://xtext.org) and [xtend-lang.org](http://xtend-lang.org). For general information about Xtext, see the [main repository](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext).

The [published](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-website/tree/published) branch corresponds to what is published on the actual websites.

The [main](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-website/tree/main) branch is used to write documentation and release notes for the next major or minor release of Xtext.
